# Locked Decisions

Last updated: 2026-05-06

This file records decisions that future sessions should treat as settled unless the user explicitly reopens them.

## Operating Decisions

| Date | Decision | Owner | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-30 | Codex/Claude acts as senior engineer/orchestrator: owns security, quality, architecture, contracts, and verification; delegates simple to medium-complexity work to OpenCode agents when available. | User | `AGENTS.md`, Claude memory migration |
| 2026-04-30 | User retains business and architecture ownership. Stop and consult before making product or architecture decisions. | User | `AGENTS.md` |
| 2026-04-30 | Stay on `revamp/v2`; use one checkpoint commit per named phase or subphase. Subagents do not commit. | User | `apps/api_v2/docs/orchestration/handoff.md` |
| 2026-05-02 | `docs/continuity/` is the canonical durable memory location for progress, decisions, open questions, and tool state. | Codex | This continuity setup |
| 2026-05-02 | `docs/continuity/` is the only durable project-memory workflow. Do not add external documentation mirrors or secondary handoff stores unless the user explicitly reopens this. | User | Current continuity cleanup directive |

## Product And Architecture Decisions

| Date | Decision | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-02 | Backend and database move first; `web_v2` adapts to the new contracts. | Do not constrain API/database shape to current mocks. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Visible auxiliary surfaces remain in v2 scope. | Analytics, notifications, billing, and API keys are real product areas. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Project access is API-driven through an `access` block on project responses. | Use backend hardcoded role-to-capability rules, not client-side role reimplementation. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Forms and widgets use server-side drafts as the durable source of record. | Browser local state is only a short-lived UX buffer. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Draft topology is one shared draft per resource with optimistic concurrency. | Include version, updatedBy, updatedAt; stale writes fail clearly. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Public submit stays on one canonical route for testimonials public submit. | Trust modes are browser Origin and HMAC signing-secret trust. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Failed HMAC must hard-reject and must not fall through to Origin validation. | HMAC is evaluated first when `X-Tresta-Signature` is present. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | API keys are not public submit trust. | API keys are for authenticated private/project APIs only. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Trust and host configuration are normalized. | Use first-class trusted origins, signing secrets, and hosted/public surface models. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Default hosted domains are derived from project slug and feature. | Use wildcard DNS plus app-level routing, not per-project DNS mutations. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | API resolves and authorizes public hosts; `web_v2` renders public page experiences. | Keep trust and multi-tenant host logic centralized in API. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Custom domains are modeled now, but self-serve verification is deferred. | Schema should support custom domains before UX/cert automation exists. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Every successful form submission creates a `CollectionFormSubmission`. | Submissions are canonical for answers, ratings, trust metadata, and analytics inputs. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Testimonials are projections from submissions for current testimonial-focused flows. | Projection is explicit, not inferred from arbitrary form labels. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Form-to-testimonial projection uses `testimonialMapping` keyed by stable field IDs. | Map content, author, company, rating, and similar fields explicitly. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | `Testimonial.rating` remains a 1-5 public display rating. | NPS/custom scales stay on submissions as analytics/routing data. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Testimonial PII is hard-split out of display-safe testimonial rows. | Email, IP, user-agent, hashes, and retention metadata belong in private metadata. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Billing starts as read-only projections. | Plan, subscription, and invoice history are visible; payment mutations remain disabled until provider behavior is settled. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-02 | Analytics must include event capture, not only read endpoints. | Public form views, widget loads, testimonial impressions, and related events should populate real analytics. | Consolidated gap map |
| 2026-05-03 | Keep Clerk as the primary auth provider. | Clerk owns identity, sessions, login OAuth, organization membership, and connected-account OAuth where suitable; Tresta owns authorization, project ownership, API credentials, integrations, and delivery behavior. | Current auth architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Use Clerk Organizations as the workspace/account layer. | Tresta stores a local organization mirror keyed by Clerk organization ID; one Clerk organization can own many Tresta projects. | Current auth architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Use an Appwrite-like control-plane hierarchy without copying Appwrite's generic product surface. | Organization owns projects; projects own credentials, public surfaces, integrations, submissions, testimonials, and analytics. Tresta remains domain-specific to feedback/testimonials. | Current product architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Keep v1 project permissions simple. | Clerk org admins manage credentials, integrations, dangerous settings, members, and billing; org members can operate project content. Defer project-level member roles unless the user reopens this. | Current auth architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Build v1 as integration-first, not conservative-minimal. | Inbound collection, outbound webhooks, CSV export, and thin Slack/Notion/Linear/GitHub exports are differentiators. Avoid deep bidirectional sync in v1. | Current product architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Agent access is a first-class v1 pillar. | Ship scoped agent keys and an official MCP adapter over private APIs so AI agents can inspect and manage safe Tresta workflows. | Current product architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | Original feedback is immutable. | Agents, API keys, and integrations may annotate, moderate, suggest display copy, publish/unpublish when scoped, and export. They must not silently rewrite collected submission content. | Current trust architecture discussion |
| 2026-05-03 | The v1 control-plane implementation plan is `docs/plans/2026-05-03-v1-auth-integrations-agent-access-implementation-plan.md`. | Use it as the implementation entrypoint after the continuity docs when starting the next phase. | Current planning checkpoint |
| 2026-05-03 | Private API keys and agent keys are project-bound scoped credentials, not public submit trust. | Store only scrypt hashes; show raw secrets only once on create/rotate; map valid credentials into `ActorContext`; keep read integration/export/webhook scopes below write-level `MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS`. | V1 Task 2 implementation checkpoint |
| 2026-05-06 | Public submit idempotency is surface-scoped and only completed responses can replay. | `PublicSubmitIdempotency` uses project + surface + key uniqueness; form and testimonial keys cannot collide; in-flight duplicate keys return `409 Conflict` instead of replaying the placeholder response. | Security audit refresh |
| 2026-05-06 | Public submit throttling is mode-specific and counts invalid attempts before returning trust errors. | Public list reads, browser submits, and HMAC submits use separate named buckets. Malformed Origin/HMAC attempts use a slug + IP invalid-submit bucket; if the bucket is blocked, the throttling error wins. | Security audit refresh |
| 2026-05-06 | API-key prefixes are routing hints, not unique authentication proof. | Authentication checks every active candidate with the same public prefix and accepts only the row whose scrypt hash matches the supplied secret. | Security audit refresh |

## Superseded Decisions

| Older decision | Superseded by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Billing, API keys, notifications, analytics out of scope for the original API rebuild. | Visible auxiliary surfaces stay in scope for backend-first v2 completion. | The older statement remains true for the completed original rebuild only, not the current continuation. |
| `apps/api_v2/docs/orchestration/handoff.md` is the live phase ledger. | `docs/continuity/progress.md` is now the live phase ledger. | The old handoff remains evidence for original phase details and commit hashes. |
