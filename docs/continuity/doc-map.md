## Historical Or Archival

| Path                                                      | Status                        | Notes                                                                                                            |

| `docs/codex-claude-memory-migration.md`                   | Historical migration layer.   | Useful for old Claude memory context; superseded as start point by `docs/continuity/`.                           |
| `memory/MEMORY.md`                                        | Archival repo memory.         | Contains older state, much of it predates the current backend-first continuation.                                |
| `memory/decisions.md`                                     | Archival decisions.           | Older decisions may be superseded by `docs/continuity/decisions.md`.                                             |
| `API_GAPS_FOR_V2.md`                                      | Historical gap list.          | Use only as background; current gap map lives under `docs/plans/`.                                               |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-01-api-ui-db-gap-map.md`              | Older gap map.                | Superseded by the 2026-05-02 consolidated gap map.                                                               |
| `docs/plans/2026-05-01-web-v2-api-wiring-requirements.md` | Older UI wiring requirements. | Still useful for UI inventory, but current backend-first decisions supersede open questions where they conflict. |

## Rule For New Docs

New durable docs go under `docs/continuity/` unless they are implementation plans with a short shelf life. If a plan creates long-lived decisions or progress, copy the durable part into `decisions.md`, `progress.md`, or `open-questions.md`.
