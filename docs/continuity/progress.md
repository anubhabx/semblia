## Current Snapshot

- Branch at last sync: `revamp/v2`.
- Git state before the V1 Task 6 implementation checkpoint: `revamp/v2...origin/revamp/v2 [ahead 41]`, clean worktree.
- Current stage: V1 Task 6 agent access and MCP server implemented and verified, pending checkpoint commit.
- Current checkpoint: V1 Task 6 local checkpoint pending commit. V1 Task 5 native thin integrations remain committed as `8e82c74`; security hardening remains committed as `0bc7bd1`.
- Latest committed implementation checkpoint: V1 Task 5 added project-scoped native integration connections, Clerk connected-account token retrieval, Slack/Notion/Linear/GitHub one-way export adapters, native export delivery queueing, shared DTOs, and provider-mapping tests.
- Next implementation checkpoint after Task 6: V1 Task 7 OpenAPI and developer-facing contracts.

Always re-run `git status --short --branch` and `git log --oneline -12` before using this snapshot as current state.

## Executive Status

The original `api_v2` rebuild has been completed through its cross-cutting validation phase. The newer backend-first continuation, driven by the consolidated API/UI/database decisions, has completed the first database/API foundation slices:

- normalized public trust and host foundations
- canonical form submission writes
- testimonial private metadata split
- shared server-side drafts for forms and widgets

The project is not yet at the main `web_v2` wiring pass. The correct path is to finish API-side canonical contracts and auxiliary surfaces first, then adapt `web_v2` to those contracts.

On 2026-05-03, the v1 product/architecture stance was locked: Clerk remains primary auth, Clerk Organizations become the workspace/account layer, Tresta projects remain the product/security boundary, v1 differentiates through in/out integrations and agent-native access, and original collected feedback remains immutable.

Also on 2026-05-03, the first two v1 control-plane implementation checkpoints landed: the Clerk organization/actor foundation is committed, and scoped private API keys plus scoped agent keys are committed in `apps/api_v2`.

On 2026-05-06, implementation paused for a fresh V2 security audit of the recently landed public trust, form submission, testimonial PII, draft, organization, and credential surfaces. The audit found no dependency advisories affecting the V2 workspaces and produced root hardening fixes for public-submit idempotency, invalid-submit throttling, and API-key prefix-collision handling. The UI gap map was refreshed against the new credential and agent-access API surface.

On 2026-05-08, V1 Task 3 landed the feedback integrity API surface. `CollectionFormSubmission` is now the immutable source record with workflow moderation state; annotations, display suggestions, and project actor audit rows are separate workflow/presentation layers. Agents and API keys can annotate, moderate, suggest display copy, and publish/unpublish only through scoped capability-gated routes; display-copy approval is restricted to user actors.

Later on 2026-05-08, V1 Task 4 added the outbound webhook and async CSV export foundation. Projects now have capability-gated webhook endpoint management, one-time encrypted webhook secrets, signed async delivery processing, delivery retries, and audit rows for mutating actions. CSV exports now create async database-backed delivery artifacts with display-safe testimonial fields only, download readiness checks, project isolation, and an `export.delivery_failed` webhook event hook.

On 2026-05-10, V1 Task 5 added native thin integrations. Projects can now store Slack, Notion, Linear, and GitHub integration connections, resolve user connected-account OAuth tokens through a Clerk-backed token-provider boundary, queue one-way native export deliveries, and map safe feedback/testimonial payloads into provider-native messages, pages, and issues without bidirectional sync.

Later on 2026-05-10, V1 Task 6 added the local stdio MCP server package for agent clients, a project analytics summary endpoint for agent-safe read workflows, and project-list credential boundary hardening. The MCP server uses `TRESTA_API_BASE_URL` and `TRESTA_AGENT_KEY`, calls the stable private API routes only, exposes safe tools/resources/prompts, and never connects directly to the database. Analytics event capture and rollups are still future auxiliary work; the new summary endpoint is a read projection over existing daily rows and live submission/impression tables.

## Operational Notes

- Public form submissions now use `CollectionFormSubmission` as the canonical answer/rating/trust record.
- New public testimonial/form writes keep email, IP, and user agent out of `Testimonial`; sensitive raw values move to encrypted private metadata with normalized hashes.
- Public submit responses omit `authorEmail`; authenticated testimonial reads rehydrate it from private metadata with a legacy row fallback.
- Draft writes require `expectedVersion`; first save uses `expectedVersion: 0`; stale writes return `409 Conflict`.
- `web_v2` still has major mock-backed surfaces and should not be treated as wired.
- The organization/actor foundation from the 2026-05-03 v1 control-plane plan is checkpoint-committed as `ffae2cf`.
- Active Clerk organization sessions now resolve project access by `project.organization.clerkOrgId`; mismatches hard-fail instead of falling back to legacy user ownership.
- Projects created while a Clerk organization is active are attached to the local organization mirror.
- Prisma migrations are no longer ignored by the root or package-local `.gitignore` files; the organization migration and previously hidden migration artifacts are now visible to Git.
- Private API keys and agent keys are distinct from public submit trust and server submit HMAC secrets.
- Private/agent key raw secrets are generated once, stored as scrypt hashes, exposed only in create/rotate responses, and list/event endpoints return metadata only.
- API-key bearer auth maps valid project-bound credentials into `ActorContext` as `api_key` or `agent_key`, then `CapabilityGuard` resolves access from scopes.
- API-key bearer auth checks every active row matching the public key prefix and accepts only the row whose stored scrypt hash matches the supplied secret.
- Agent presets are `READ_ONLY`, `CONTENT_MANAGER`, `AUTOMATION_MANAGER`, and `DEVELOPER`; disallowed source-write, billing, member, credential-reveal, and project-delete scopes are not in the launch scope set.
- Read-only export/webhook/integration scopes map to `VIEW_INTEGRATIONS`, not `MANAGE_INTEGRATIONS`.
- Public submit idempotency is now surface-scoped; form and testimonial idempotency keys no longer collide, and duplicate requests only replay completed response bodies.
- Invalid public submit trust attempts are counted by the custom public-submit throttler before the trust error is rethrown, and public list/browser submit/HMAC submit buckets stay separate.
- Submission annotations, moderation updates, display suggestions, display approvals/rejections, and testimonial publish/unpublish actions now create project actor audit rows.
- Display suggestions are presentation-layer records. User actors can approve them into `Testimonial.content`; agent/API-key actors can suggest but cannot approve display copy.
- Rejecting or flagging a linked submission unpublishes the projected testimonial and does not mutate submission answers, rating values, or private metadata.
- Outbound webhook endpoint secrets are encrypted with `API_V2_SECRET_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; raw `whsec_...` values are exposed only in create and rotate responses.
- Outbound webhook deliveries are signed with `X-Tresta-Event`, `X-Tresta-Delivery`, `X-Tresta-Timestamp`, and `X-Tresta-Signature: v1=<hmac>`.
- Outbound webhook dispatch has a bounded network wait and bounded response capture: requests time out after 10 seconds, and stored response snippets are capped without reading arbitrary-size remote bodies.
- V1 webhook subscriptions require explicit event names only; no wildcard subscription exists in Task 4.
- CSV export deliveries store artifacts in the database for v1 and include display-safe testimonial fields only. Private metadata, IP, user agent, raw answers, and email are excluded by default.
- Export delivery failures emit the generic `export.delivery_failed` outbound webhook event for subscribed endpoints.
- Native integration connections are project-scoped `IntegrationConnection` records with provider, auth strategy, connected user, optional Clerk provider name, scopes, status, and provider config.
- Native integration exports reuse `ExportDestination` and `ExportDelivery` records, with a separate `native-integration-export` queue for Slack, Notion, Linear, and GitHub deliveries.
- Clerk connected OAuth tokens are resolved server-side through `ClerkConnectedAccountTokenProvider`; missing or revoked connected tokens fail as connect-required authorization errors.
- V1 native integrations are intentionally one-way. They create Slack messages, Notion pages, Linear issues, or GitHub issues from safe export payloads and do not import remote edits, sync provider membership, or depend on provider webhooks for core Tresta state.
- Project-scoped API keys and agent keys can list only their bound project from `GET /v2/projects` and cannot create projects. Creation remains a user-session action.
- `GET /v2/projects/:slug/analytics/summary` is a project-scoped read endpoint over existing analytics daily rows and live submission/impression counts. It does not complete the future analytics capture/rollup slice.
- `packages/tresta-mcp-server` is the official local stdio MCP adapter for Task 6. It uses `TRESTA_API_BASE_URL` and `TRESTA_AGENT_KEY`, exposes safe feedback/testimonial/export/delivery tools, resources, and prompts, and calls private APIs instead of the database.
- MCP export triggering uses the actual Task 4/5 API shapes: CSV via `POST /v2/projects/:slug/exports/csv`, native integrations via `POST /v2/projects/:slug/integrations/connections/:connectionId/exports`.
- Root `pnpm.overrides.hono` is pinned to `4.12.18` so the Prisma tooling path no longer matches the May 2026 Hono advisories.
- Broad `web_v2` wiring stays deferred until the remaining backend-canonical V1 differentiator surfaces are complete.

## Latest Verification

## Known Doc Drift

- `docs/plans/2026-05-08-web-v2-api-types-gap-inventory.md` was current after V1 Task 3, but is now stale for outbound webhooks, exports, native integrations, Prisma models, and shared DTOs after the Task 4 and Task 5 implementations.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-02-api-surface-implementation-phases.md` has been annotated so its original starting point does not override this live ledger.
- `apps/api_v2/docs/orchestration/handoff.md` has been annotated so original-rebuild scope language does not override the current auxiliary-surface decisions.
- `memory/` and `docs/codex-claude-memory-migration.md` are historical context, not the live progress ledger.
- `docs/plans/2026-05-03-v1-auth-integrations-agent-access-implementation-plan.md` expands the earlier Phase 1e auxiliary product scope and remains the current plan; Tasks 1 through 6 are implemented, and Task 7 OpenAPI/developer-facing contracts is the next planned checkpoint.
