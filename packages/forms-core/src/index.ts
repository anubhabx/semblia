/**
 * forms-core — the single owner of the Tresta Forms v4 contract.
 *
 * Three separated concerns (docs/plans/2026-06-11-forms-v4-parametric-theming.md):
 *   structure  — what's asked (./schema)
 *   layout     — which hand-designed preset (./schema)
 *   appearance — constrained knobs → derivation engine (./theme)
 *
 * Subpath entrypoints (`/schema`, `/theme`, `/telemetry`, `/render`) are the
 * preferred imports — they tree-shake to exactly what a consumer uses. The
 * root barrel re-exports the same v4 surface for convenience.
